        This screen demonstrates how to use side effects with a feature built with the TCA.

        A side effect is a work item that needs to be performed in the outside world. For example, \
        an API request to an external service over HTTP

        Many things  in our applications can be represented as side effects, such as timers, network requests, \
        database requests, events observing, socket connections debouncing, throttling and delaying, etc.

        This application has two simple side effects:

        ‚Ä¢ Tapping "Generate fact" will trigger an API request to load a fact about the number
        ‚Ä¢ Tapping "Random fact" will change current number value and do the same

        Both effects are handled by the reducer, and a full test suite is written to confirm \
        that the effects behave in the way we expect.
